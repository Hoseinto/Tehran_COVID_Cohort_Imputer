# Data Cleaning and Imputation for Tehran COVID Database

Hello! I'm Dr. Hossein Toreyhi, a medical doctor and programmer with a passion for deep learning and AI projects, particularly in the fields of COVID-19, cardiovascular health, and cardiology. With a background in medicine and programming, I'm dedicated to leveraging AI to enhance our understanding and management of critical healthcare issues.

In this GitHub repository, I present my work on cleaning and imputing the Tehran COVID database. I have meticulously processed the data to ensure its accuracy and reliability for further analysis. To accomplish this, I employed various Python libraries, including:

- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `pylab` for data visualization
- `missingno` for handling missing data
- `fancyimpute` for advanced imputation techniques, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and iterative imputation

In addition to data cleaning, I thoroughly investigated and compared different imputation methods using the `statsmodels` library. This rigorous analysis helped ensure the quality and completeness of the dataset, making it suitable for in-depth research and analysis.

The primary focus of this project aligns with the main objectives of the broader initiative, which includes studying critical outcomes related to COVID-19. These outcomes are vital in understanding the impact of the virus and guiding healthcare decisions. The main outcomes explored in this project include:

- **Mortality:** Understanding and predicting mortality rates among COVID-19 patients.
- **Intubation:** Investigating the need for intubation in severe cases.
- **Dialysis:** Assessing the requirement for dialysis in patients with kidney complications.
- **ICU Admission:** Analyzing factors leading to ICU admission for COVID-19 patients.

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Amir Safavi Naieni, whose support and guidance have been instrumental in making this project possible. Dr. Naieni's mentorship has allowed me to combine my medical expertise with programming skills, opening up exciting opportunities to contribute to the field of healthcare AI.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I hope that the work presented here contributes to our collective understanding of COVID-19 and cardiovascular health. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated.
