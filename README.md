## Data Cleaning and Imputation for Tehran COVID Database

In this GitHub repository, I present my work on cleaning and imputing the Tehran COVID database. I have meticulously processed the data to ensure its accuracy and reliability for further analysis. In addition to data cleaning, I thoroughly investigated and compared different imputation methods using the `statsmodels` library. This rigorous analysis helped ensure the quality and completeness of the dataset, making it suitable for in-depth research and analysis.

The primary focus of this project aligns with the main objectives of the broader initiative, which includes studying critical outcomes related to COVID-19. These outcomes are vital in understanding the impact of the virus and guiding healthcare decisions. The main outcomes explored in this project include:

- **Mortality:** Understanding and predicting mortality rates among COVID-19 patients.
- **Intubation:** Investigating the need for intubation in severe cases.
- **Dialysis:** Assessing the requirement for dialysis in patients with kidney complications.
- **ICU Admission:** Analyzing factors leading to ICU admission for COVID-19 patients.

The dataset used in this project was collected as part of the following phases:

Phase I Registry (2019-2020): Emam Hossein Hospital, Taleghani Hospital, Shohada-E-Tajrish Hospital

Phase II (2021-2022): Emam Hossein Hospital, Loghman Hospital
